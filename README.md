# ArcGIS Maps JavaScript SDK - Circle and Point Graphics Manipulation
This project showcases how to add and remove circle and point graphics on an ArcGIS Map using the ArcGIS Maps JavaScript SDK.

Description
This code provides functionality to add point or circle graphics on an ArcGIS Map based on user selection from radio buttons. Users can select between adding point or circle graphics on the map, and the map will respond accordingly to the user's choice. Additionally, the project allows users to delete either all circle or all point graphics from the map.

Usage
Include the ArcGIS Maps JavaScript SDK in your project.
Create a new ArcGIS Map and MapView.
Add radio buttons for the user to select between adding point or circle graphics.
Add functionality to handle user selections and add corresponding graphics to the map.
Optionally, provide a button or mechanism to delete either all circle or all point graphics from the map.
Example
Here is a sample implementation of adding and removing circle and point graphics:

When the "Point" radio button is selected, clicking on the map will add a point graphic at the clicked location.
When the "Circle" radio button is selected, clicking on the map will prompt the user to enter a radius, and a circle graphic will be added at the clicked location with the specified radius.
Clicking the "Delete Circle Graphics" button will remove all circle graphics from the map.
Clicking the "Delete Point Graphics" button will remove all point graphics from the map.
